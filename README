Read `README.lambdamoo' for general information on LambdaMOO.

This is release 7 of the Stunt extensions to the LambdaMOO server.  It
is based on wrog's "1.8.4" version from SourceForge.  Read the very
important WARNING below before running this on your existing
database!!

Stunt includes the following functionality not found in the main
server:

1) Multiple-Inheritance
   `create()' now takes either an object number or a list of object
   numbers in the first argument position.  Two new built-ins,
   `parents()' and `chparents()', manipulate an object's parents.  The
   built-ins `parent()' and `chparent()' exist for backward
   compatibility -- when an object has multiple parents these
   built-ins operate on the first parent.

2) Task Local Storage
   The built-ins `task_local' and `set_task_local' retrieve/store a
   task local value.

3) Map Datatype
   The server includes a native map datatype based on a binary search
   tree (specifically, a red-black tree).  The implementation allows
   in-order traversal, efficient lookup/insertion/deletion, and
   supports existing MOO datatypes as values (keys may not be lists or
   maps).

4) JSON Parsing/Generation
   The built-ins `parse_json' and `generate_json' transform MOO
   datatypes from/to JSON.

5) New Built-in Cryptographic Operations
   The new cryptographic operations include SHA-1 and SHA-256 hashes.
   The existing MD5 hash algorithm is broken from a cryptographic
   standpoint, as is SHA-1 -- both are included for interoperability
   with existing applications (both are still popular) but the default
   for `string_hash'/`binary_hash'/`value_hash' is now SHA-256.  Stunt
   also includes the HMAC-SHA-256 algorithm for generating secure,
   hash- based message authentication codes.

6) Built-in Base64 Encoding/Decoding
   The built-ins `encode_base64' and `decode_base64' encode and decode
   Base64-encoded strings.

7) An Improved FileIO Patch
   The 1.5p1 patch that is in wide circulation has flaws, including two
   server crashing bugs.  This patch fixes those bugs/flaws without
   changing the API.

8) Secure Suspending Process Exec
   The exec functionality adds an `exec' built-in which securely
   forks/execs an external executable.  It doesn't use the `system()'
   call, which is hard to secure and which blocks the server.
   `exec()' takes two parameters, a list of strings comprising the
   program and its arguments, and a MOO binary string that is sent to
   stdin.  It suspends the current task so the server can continue
   serving other tasks, and eventually returns the process termination
   code, stdout, and stderr in a list.

9) Verb Calls on Primitive Types
   The server supports verbs calls on primitive types (numbers,
   strings, etc.) so calls like `"foo bar":split()' can be implemented
   and work as expected (they were always syntactically correct but
   resulted in an E_TYPE error).  Verbs are implemented on prototype
   object delegates ($int_proto, $float_proto, $str_proto, etc.).  The
   server transparently invokes the correct verb on the appropriate
   prototype -- the primitive value is the value of `this'.

10) In Server HTTP Parsing
    The server uses the excellent Node HTTP parsing library to
    natively parse HTTP requests and responses into key/value pairs in
    a map datatype.  The parser handles corner cases correctly and
    supports things like HTTP upgrade (for using WebSockets, for
    example).  It's also much much faster than parsers implemented in
    MOO code.

11) Testing Framework
    The server includes a unit testing framework based on Ruby's
    Test-Unit.  It includes a Parslet parser (two, actually) for
    turning moo-code values into Ruby values, which makes writing
    tests much easier.  The new code is covered very well by the
    existing tests.

WARNING: This server changes the database format in a non-backward
compatible way in order to persist multiple-parent relationships.  The
server will automatically upgrade version 4 databases, however THERE
IS NO WAY BACK!
