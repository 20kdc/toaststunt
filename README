Read `README.lambdamoo' for general information on LambdaMOO.

This is release 4 of the Stunt extensions to the LambdaMOO server.  It
is based on wrog's "1.8.4" version from SourceForge.  Read the very
important WARNING below before running this on your existing
database!!

Stunt includes the following functionality not found in the main
server:

1) Multiple-Inheritance
   `create()' now takes either an object number or a list of object
   numbers in the first argument position.  Two new built-ins,
   `parents()' and `chparents()', manipulate an object's parents.  The
   built-ins `parent()' and `chparent()' exist for backward
   compatibility.

2) Testing Framework
   The server includes a unit testing framework based on Ruby's
   Test-Unit.  It includes a Parslet parser (two, actually) for
   turning moo-code values into Ruby values, which makes writing tests
   much easier.  The new code is covered very well by the existing
   tests.

WARNING: This server changes the database format in a non-backward
compatible way in order to persist multiple-parent relationships.  The
server will automatically upgrade version 4 databases, however THERE
IS NO WAY BACK!

Use Github and the Github issue system for feedback and bugs!
